AI-Based Image/Video Detection Project – 10 Steps

Define Project Scope and Features

Upload images/videos

Detect objects (people, cars, animals, etc.)

Generate analytics (counts, timestamps, object types)

Annotated media output

Optional advanced features: alerts, heatmaps, real-time detection

----------------------------------------------------

Choose AI Detection Library

Options: YOLOv8 (Ultralytics), OpenCV + pre-trained models, PyTorch/TensorFlow

Decide which objects to detect and if you need pre-trained or custom models

-------------------------------------------------
Set Up Python Environment

Create Python project (virtual environment or inside Docker)

Install packages: AI libraries, Flask/FastAPI, Redis library, storage client (e.g., boto3)

Organize file structure:

/app
  /api
  /worker
  /models

-----------------------------------------
Set Up Storage

MinIO (S3-compatible) for uploaded and processed files

PostgreSQL for metadata: file info, detected objects, timestamps, analytics

Test uploading and downloading files

----------------------------------------  

Set Up Redis for Task Queue

Install Redis (will run in Docker)

Use Celery or RQ to manage async tasks:

Web/API pushes tasks

Worker processes them asynchronously

----------------------------------------------
Build the Web/API Interface

Endpoint for file uploads (images/videos)

Save uploaded files to storage

Push processing tasks to Redis queue

Optional: endpoint to retrieve results and analytics

------------------------------------------------------
Build the Worker for AI Processing

Worker fetches tasks from Redis

Image processing: run object detection and annotate bounding boxes/labels

Video processing: split into frames, detect objects per frame, recompile annotated video

Generate analytics: object counts, types, timestamps

Save processed files and analytics to storage/database

----------------------------------------------------------
Dockerize Each Component

Use Docker Compose for multi-container setup:

Web/API container – Flask/FastAPI

Worker container – Celery/RQ + AI processing

Redis container – task queue

MinIO container – file storage

Optional: PostgreSQL container – metadata

--------------------------------------------   

Build Dashboard or API to Display Analytics

Display annotated images/videos

Show object counts and charts

Optional advanced features: filter by object type, heatmaps, timelines, alerts

------------------------------------------ 
Test, Optimize, and Scale

Test with images and videos of different sizes

Optimize: batch frame processing, caching, worker scaling

Optional: real-time video processing, multiple AI models
